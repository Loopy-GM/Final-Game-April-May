POST MORTEM:
    The project was live from April 27, 2021 to May 20, 2021. The original end goal was to make randomly generated mazes for my game, but the goal changed due to how complex a randomly gnerated maze really was.
    
   The final product was a shell of a maze game with a simple dummy AI that doesn't do anything, this differs from the original vision because everytime a level was passed there would've been a meme or something similar that cleared the screen.
    
   With the skillset I have, I am somewhat satisfied due to the amount of time I missed, but the code is good with what I know. During the project I had a good time using part of what I learned to do in code before, but I think I could've done better on my time management and implementing new pieces of code like my collision.
    
   I learned how much a rubber duck actualy can help during the debugging process and how going through the step of fixing a bug can uncover mission or unessesary parts of code. In my free-time I will most likely work on the game a couple of times but I will not stress myself out on a project with no deadline(basically).
    
   Next time I would start with a simple vision and work up to a better game as I code it and experience new features instead of working up to a specific goal.
