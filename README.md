# Runner Game Design Document

The game is a simple top-down view game where your character runs through the map and gets to the goal.

The goal is as simple as colliding with a block colored green.

Mechanics are walls that can be phased through, but they still stop the player if there is direct collision and the player uses arrow keys to move.

Possible power ups include a star that just annoys the player.

Progression is just playing through different maps.

Possible timer.

The game will have simple graphics(squares) to make up the entirety of the game.
